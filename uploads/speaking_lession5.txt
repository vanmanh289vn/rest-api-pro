CORRECT A MISUNDERSTANDING
This isn’t what I mean.
I’m sorry about the confusion.
I’m sorry but I think you got it all wrong.
That’s not it. What I am trying to say is..
----------------------------------------------------
INTERRUPT SOMEBODY POLITELY
Can I come in?
If I can just stop you for a moment.
Sorry to interrupt you, but…
Excuse me, if I may say something before we move on…
-------------------------------------------------------------
REFER BACK TO WHAT WAS SAID
As we were saying earlier…
To go back to what was I saying..
-----------------------------------
CHECK OR CLARITY
Are you suggesting/saying/implying that…?
If I understand you correctly…
You said…. Did I get it right?
-----------------------------------
CLOSING
We are running out of time.
Let me go over what’s been said.
To sum it all up..
Unless anyone has anything else to add, I think that’s it. Thank you all for coming.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(CORRECT A MISUNDERSTANDING --> That’s not it. What I am trying to say is..) The employees’ performance exceeds expectations. 
For this reason, I would like to propose a celebration. 
Like a company party to recognize and celebrate the success of the company.


(INTERRUPT SOMEBODY --> Sorry to interrupt you, but…) The company CEO is on the phone. He would like to speak with you.

(REFER BACK TO A TOPIC --> To go back to what was I saying..) The caller was so upset that he was shouting at me. 
Then, he realized he called the wrong number. It was really funny.

(CLARIFY --> You said…. Did I get it right?) The boss found you sleeping at your desk?!

(CLOSING --> Let me go over what’s been said.) The party is going to be held at the Plaza Hotel. Everybody should wear a wig. Party starts at 7:00.



----------------------------------

1/ Have you ever interrupted a meeting or conversation?  Can you share something about it?
--> Yes, I have. That's when I realized I forgot to bring my laptop into the company meeting room to do the demo
At that time I left the meeting room to get my laptop, then when I came back I said: can I come in?

2/ What are the common interruptions in a meeting?
--> The following cases may be mentioned:
		First, someone asked permission to enter the meeting room
		Second, maybe someone is talking and has an incoming call ...

3/ How do you deal with interruptions?
--> I will smile and be ready to listen to what the person has to say


4/ What was the longest meeting you’ve ever had? Please tell something about it.

--> I was most impressed by a meeting a long time ago.
Although this meeting was not long, it was held at midnight, exactly at 0 o'clock.
That's when I did a project with an American client, it was really a special meeting

5/ Have you ever misunderstood someone that caused confusion? Tell about it.

--> Of course
That's when in a meeting I misunderstood what the project manager said.
He wanted me to finish the task the next morning, but I mistakenly had to finish the task that day.
